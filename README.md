# 👋 Hi, I'm Lucas McMahon

I'm a cybersecurity professional with a Bachelor of Science in **Cyber Criminology** from Florida State University and certifications including **CompTIA CySA+**, **Security+**, and **Network+**. I have hands-on experience in security analysis, threat detection, digital forensics, and network monitoring, supported by practical labs using tools like **Splunk, Wazuh, LimaCharlie, Zeek, Wireshark**, and **ELK**.

My background includes both technical troubleshooting and real-world incident analysis, equipping me to identify threats, respond to breaches, and improve defensive security posture in fast-paced environments.

## 🎯 Objective

To contribute as a **Security Analyst** by applying my knowledge, investigating real threats, and continuously growing in the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape. I’m passionate about building strong detection capabilities, solving complex problems, and keeping networks safe.
